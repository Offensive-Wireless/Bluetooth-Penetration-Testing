#### CVE-2023-24023 - BLUFFS: Bluetooth Forward and Future Secrecy Attacks and Defenses

**Description:** CVE-2023-24023, known as BLUFFS, identifies vulnerabilities in Bluetooth's cryptographic procedures that can potentially allow attackers to compromise the forward and future secrecy of Bluetooth communications.&#x20;

These attacks exploit weaknesses in the pairing process, enabling unauthorized access to previously encrypted data and potentially decrypting future communications.

**Impact:** If successfully exploited, an attacker could intercept, decrypt, and manipulate Bluetooth communications, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to Bluetooth-enabled devices, and potential privacy violations.

**Mitigation:** To mitigate the risks associated with BLUFFS, ensuring Bluetooth devices have up-to-date firmware, implementing stronger encryption protocols, and adhering to best security practices in Bluetooth environments are recommended.
